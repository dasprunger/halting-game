            <h4>Phase 1</h4>
            <p>Make graphics methods and test them using the developer tools.
            For this project, I wrote methods to draw an X, draw an O, and
            clear a square, then tested them out.</p>
            <h4>Phase 2</h4>
            <p>Decide how you're going to represent your game. You need some
            variables so that the computer can keep track of what happens behind
            the scenes. For this, I decided I would keep an array of 9 items
            (all of which are "b" for blank, "x" for X, and "o" for O) to represent
            the board. (Check out the "currentPosition" variable in the Javascript.)</p>
            <h4>Phase 3</h4>
            <p>Write some functions to deal with the game for you. For this, I needed
            to write a function to see if it was legal to put a mark in a square,
            to actually put the mark in the square, to figure out whose turn
            it was, and to check if someone had won.</p>
            <h4>Phase 4</h4>
            <p>Wire up the game logic and the display. Usually for this you'll need
            to write some mouse click handlers or maybe use the prompt() function.
